# Generating a Binary Classifier for Selecting Applicants for Alphabet Soup to Fund Based on Predicted Success

## Purpose of the Analysis

## Developing the Model: Analysis Questions
### Data Processing
- What variable(s) are the target(s) for your model?
- What variable(s) are the features for your model?
- What variable(s) should be removed from the input data because they are neither targets nor features?

### Compiling, Training, and Evaluating the Model
- How many neurons, layers, and activation functions did you select for your neural network model, and why?
- Were you able to achieve the target model performance?
- What steps did you take in your attempts to increase model performance?

## Results

## Continuing On
This model used a neural network to generate a binary classifier, but there are other models that would also be useful.
One choice would be a decision tree classifier.
The main benefit of this model is that the choice nodes may be visibly expressed.
Alphabet Soup, being a charity, is likely as concerned with how a decision is being reached as it is with whether the decision is likely to result in success.
